                <h2>Doggos<a name="#Dogs"></a></h2>
                <p class="projtype"> We currently have 3 dogs that make up our family. We have 'Tars' who is the alpha and grumpiest (Yorkie/Pug mix), then we have Coco (Yorkie/Poodle mix) who is the old lady 
                    of the house who only cares about being pet, and lastly 'Case' (German Shepherd/American Stafford/Rat Terrier mix) who is the sweetest and most cowardly dog in the world who loves everyone and 
                    everything. We have also fostered a few doggos and we will always remember them. </p>

                <h2>Gaming/Tech<a name="#Gaming/Tech"></a></h2>
                <p class="projtype">Since I was a young kid I was always interested in technology and gaming was a huge part of it. I didn't just enjoy getting new tech, I wanted to know how it worked so everytime
                    I got something new I would immediately begin to take them apart. Growing up in a small town there really wasn't much to do so I really got into gaming during my teen years. I would play sports
                    in the summer and become a gamer during the winter. I built my first computer at 15 then everything just grew from there. I enjoy keeping up with all the new hardware, gaming, streaming, and generally
                    learning about any new product.
                </p>
                <h2>Sports<a name="#Sports"></a></h2>
                <p class="projtype">Sports have always been a big part of my life as it was the main way I would bond with my family. Everyone from my parents to cousins would gather round and watch just about any 
                    sport on tv. I follow just about every sport to this day but my favorites are definitely basketball, soccer, and football.
